        <p>SpaceX was founded in 2002 with the stated mission of sending humans to live on other planets. Headquartered in Hawthorne,
          California and employing over 6,000 people SpaceX has revolutionized the space launch industry and set the stage
          for a new era of Spaceflight. SpaceX currently operates launch facilities in California, Texas, and Florida including
          Launch Complex 39A which was previously used to launch the Apollo and Space Shuttle missions. While SpaceX has
          many incredible innovations it is best known for its Falcon 9 rocket, a reusable launch vehicle capable of lifting
          over 22,000 kg into orbit. The Falcon 9 has a success rate of 95% with 36 successful launches and over 50 launches
          currently scheduled. In addition to the Falcon 9 SpaceX is currently developing the Falcon 9 Heavy which is comprised
          of two Falcon 9 boosters and a modified Falcon 9 core, upon completion it will be the most powerful rocket launched
          since the Saturn V sent men to the Moon. SpaceX is currently responsible for resupplying the International Space
          Station as well as delivering military payloads into orbit, a mission previously handled solely by United Launch
          Alliance (ULA).

      </div>
      <div class="sectionContent">
        <p>Elon Musk (AKA real life Tony Stark) founded SpaceX on the notion that using vertical integration and a modular design
          philosophy he could reduce the cost of launches by a factor of ten thus moving humanity closer toward his ultimate
          goal of becoming a spacefaring civilization. His plan was met with skepticism and even concern from his friends,
          with one friend going so far as to make Musk watch dozens of clips of rockets exploding in an attempt to demonstrate
          how risky the space launch business was. Undeterred Musk invested a sizeable share of his fortune from his two
          previous companies, Zip2 and PayPal, and founded SpaceX. Since then Musk has worked tirelessly toward his original
          goal of getting humans to Mars by 2030, even going so far as to found numerous other companies that all play a
          part in the larger plan for a Mars colony by 2040.
